50,"I would definitely stay here again in Antigua.  It was perfect - the property is beautiful, it was very clean and comfortable, the location is fantastic, there's a great rooftop deck, and the people are very friendly.  There are cheaper places to stay - I paid $35 USD / 280 quetzales for the best room (room 12) - but Casa Cristina is worth it if you can afford it.  Use the tour agency at the hospedaje next door for transportation (they will recommend them at the front desk) - he is super friendly and reliable, and speaks English.  I used a different tour booker when I got into Antigua and got ripped off (van never showed up), but he salvaged my day by getting replacement transportation very quickly, and even waited with me to make sure it showed up.  Then I booked a volcano hike",POS
40,"Great location, in the heart of historic centre. Just one minute to walk to see one of the most beautiful church. The street where' s located is one way and a few narrow, but very quiet. Rooms small, but very clean. Staff helpful, the lady managing has given us for three days the Lonely Planet., very kind. Free wi-fi and internet at reception, and water or tea too. For a budget option in Antigua is very recommended.",POS
50,"Not only the place is nice, clean and in an excellent location, but our host Fernando was also very helpful and caring to ensure our stay was the best possible in La Antigua. I will definitely go back for a longer stay since this was a short weekend trip, and I will highly recommend it to anyone looking for a personalized attention and excellent customer service",POS
50,"We spent two nights and I wish we could have stayed longer.  The staff was very thoughful and helpful.  The rooms are nicely decorated and very clean.  Make sure to go to the roof level for beautiful views of Antigua.  The breakfast you get with your stay offers a nice variety of fresh fruit, and authentic Guatemalan dishes.  I agree with other reviews, this lovely hotel is centraly located and all the good restaurants and shops are within a 1-2 minute walk.  I hope to return next year.  Gracias por todo su atenci√≥n!!!",POS
50,"I just recently returned from Antigua and my stay at Casa Florencia. I would highly recommend this hotel. its location is perfect. everything is only five minutes walk away. The rooms are basic but absolutely spotless. i have never seen a hotel that clean. The bathroom was great. I just loved having a nice hot shower every morning. The staff consistently went out of their way to help me whenever i needed it. Stay here, you will not regret it. It also has free wi-fi, and a internet computer in the main lobby.  in my opinion the best 3 places to eat are cafe condessa, cafe bourbon, and Hectors.....",POS
40,"Really a nice and clean place to stay with a family atmosphere, great rooftop views, access to a kitchen and great staff. We were very comfortable here.  Internet and Wifi access available, coffee service onsite, walking very close to the central plaza and anything else in Antigua.  Restaurants within walking distance as well as a small tienda across the street.",POS
40,"The staff are great and there's great food on offer.  The courtyard provides a nice place to relax with hammocks, comfy seats and a fountain, a welcome escape from the noise out in the town.  When I arrived I felt like I was walking into a night club!  So if you have an early start and need an early night you might need some earplugs, but it didn't seem to go on too late.",POS
20,"We stayed at this hotel after reading so many glowing reservations. Our room was on the first floor. It was  very small and dark, although had a patio in the back with a table a chairs. The worst part of the experience was that people were eating at tables a mere 6 feet from our bathroom and toilet. Forks were rattling anf people talking incredibly close to us and the food smells were unsettling as well. The upstairs rooms looked lovely. Make sure you get one of those. The place  has a great breakfast and the terraces upstairs have amazing views and flowers.  We stayed also at  Casa Encantada and Posada de Don Rodrigo, both were excellent and we liked them much better. ",NEG
40,"Second stay here in 2 weeks. This is a typical Antigua very old converted building; built around gardens and fountains with flowers everywhere. 4 minutes to the central park.  It's not fancy, maybe a bit worn, but the prices aren't fancy either. As others have said, the farther back you are the quieter it is (avoid 8 and 9 if possible). Roof top space with decent views of the mountains. ",POS
